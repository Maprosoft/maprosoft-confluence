maprosoft-confluence
====================

# Introduction

This add-on provides integration between Confluence and Maprosoft's products - [Maproweb](http://www.maprosoft.com/maproweb.html), [Maproapp](http://www.maprosoft.com/maproapp.html) and [Maproissue](http://www.maprosoft.com/maproissue.html).

Currently the add-on provides macros to enable maps to be easily added to Confluence pages. Further integrations and enhancements are planned.

# Running

Install Atlassian's Plugin SDK as per the instructions on their website:

https://developer.atlassian.com/display/DOCS/Introduction+to+the+Atlassian+Plugin+SDK

Here are the main SDK commands you'll use to contribute to this add-on:

* atlas-run   -- installs this plugin into the product and starts it on localhost
* atlas-debug -- same as atlas-run, but allows a debugger to attach at port 5005
* atlas-cli   -- after atlas-run or atlas-debug, opens a Maven command line window:
                 - 'pi' reinstalls the plugin into the running product instance
* atlas-help  -- prints description for all commands in the SDK
